# Task 02: Implementation Plan for Quick Start Guide

## Objective
Create a dedicated quick start guide to help new users understand the emulator and run their first program within 5 minutes.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create new directory: `src/assets/documentation/00 quick start/`
2. Create main file: `getting-started.md` in the new directory
3. Add section: Welcome and overview of the emulator's purpose
4. Add section: Interface components (CPU visualization, memory view, console output)
5. Add section: "Hello World" program with complete code example
6. Add section: Step-by-step execution instructions (load, run, step through)
7. Add section: How to use breakpoints effectively
8. Add section: How to view and understand register values
9. Add section: What to do next (link to tutorial flow starting with "01 assembly guide welcome.md")
10. Update `src/assets/documentation/doclist.txt` to include the new quick start guide
11. Test the new documentation in the application to ensure proper rendering
12. Verify all "Try me" buttons work correctly with the emulator integration
