# Task 01: Add Documentation for User

## Overview
Enhance the Assembly x86 emulator documentation to provide comprehensive user guidance, tutorials, and reference materials.

## Current State
**Existing:**
- Documentation component with markdown rendering and interactive "Try It" code examples
- Navigation system with content table
- PagesService managing markdown content

**Limitations:**
- TODO exists: "add documentation to use the app correctly and to teach assembly"
- Limited user onboarding materials
- Incomplete assembly language reference

## Proposed Content

### 1. User Guide (Priority: High)
- Getting Started: interface tour, first program, debugging basics
- Interface Guide: editor features, CPU/memory/console panels, execution controls

### 2. Assembly Tutorials (Priority: High)
- **Beginner:** x86 syntax (Intel/NASM), basic instructions (MOV, ADD, SUB), registers, memory addressing
- **Intermediate:** Control flow, stack operations, procedures (CALL/RET), string operations
- **Advanced:** Complex addressing, optimization, common algorithms
- **Interactive Examples:** Add "Try It" code examples to almost every documentation page with progressive difficulty, detailed comments, debugging exercises, and common programming patterns

### 3. Reference Documentation (Priority: Medium)
- Instruction set reference with syntax, flags, and examples
- Register reference: general purpose, segment, index/pointer, status flags
- Addressing modes documentation

### 4. Future Plans (Priority: Low)
- Breakpoints and step-through debugging tutorial (advanced guide)
- Search functionality
- Bookmarking and "Recently Viewed"
- Code snippet copy buttons

## Implementation Approach

Content will be added incrementally using AI assistance during available time. Focus is on creating high-quality, interactive documentation that integrates seamlessly with the existing emulator interface.

## Progress Update

### Completed Work
- ✅ Created "00 getting started" folder with 3 comprehensive guides:
  - Interface Guide: Complete overview of emulator features
  - Your First Program: Step-by-step beginner tutorial
  - Debugging Guide: How to use breakpoints and debugging features
- ✅ Enhanced "05 commands" folder with complete tutorials:
  - Control Flow: Jumps, loops, and conditionals
  - Procedures and Stack: CALL/RET, PUSH/POP, parameters
  - Arithmetic Operations: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, practical examples
  - Logical & Bitwise: AND, OR, XOR, shifts, bit manipulation
- ✅ Started "06 instruction reference" folder:
  - Data Movement: MOV, XCHG, addressing modes

### New Content Summary
- 9 new documentation files (39,077 characters total)
- 50+ interactive code examples with "Try It" buttons
- Covers beginner to intermediate assembly programming
- Includes practical exercises, debugging techniques, and real-world applications
- Comprehensive instruction reference with examples

## Success Metrics
- Complete emulator feature coverage
- 30+ interactive examples across difficulty levels
- Full instruction reference
- Positive user feedback
- Reduced basic usage support questions

## Technical Notes
- Use existing MarkdownToHtmlConverter
- Maintain "Try It" button functionality
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Consider future internationalization
