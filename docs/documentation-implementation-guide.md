## Content Creation Guidelines

### Writing Style

1. **Tone:**
   - Friendly and encouraging
   - Technical but accessible
   - Active voice preferred
   - Direct address ("you will", not "one will")

2. **Language:**
   - Define technical terms on first use
   - Use consistent terminology
   - Avoid jargon unless explained
   - Keep sentences concise

3. **Structure:**
   - Start with objectives
   - Progress from simple to complex
   - Include visual breaks (headings, lists)
   - End with summary/next steps

### Code Examples

1. **Quality Standards:**
   - All code must be tested in the emulator
   - Include meaningful comments
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Follow assembly best practices

2. **Comment Style:**
   ```assembly
   ; Single line comments explain what the line does
   mov eax, 5          ; Load 5 into EAX
   
   ; Block comments explain why or provide context
   ; Calculate factorial of n
   ; Uses iterative approach for efficiency
   mov ecx, n
   ```

3. **Code Formatting:**
   - Use consistent indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab)
   - Align comments when practical
   - Group related operations
   - Add blank lines between logical sections

### Interactive Elements

1. **Emulator Links:**
   - Link to emulator with pre-loaded code
   - Provide "Try it yourself" sections
   - Include variations to experiment with

2. **Exercises:**
   - Provide graduated difficulty
   - Include hints before solutions
   - Offer multiple solution approaches
   - Explain why solutions work

3. **Visual Aids:**
   - Use ASCII diagrams for memory layouts
   - Include register state tables
   - Show before/after comparisons
   - Add flowcharts for algorithms

## File Naming Conventions

### Structure
```
[number]-[descriptive-name].md
```

### Examples
- `01-mov-instruction.md`
- `03-calculator-project.md`
- `05-stack-frames.md`

### Guidelines
- Use lowercase
- Separate words with hyphens
- Number files for ordering
- Keep names descriptive but concise
